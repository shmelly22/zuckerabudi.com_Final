      <blockquote>
        "The greatest way to truly notice awareness is by spending time in nature, surrounded by others also focused inward. Awareness is already here, but the ego has created countless attachments to keep itself busy. By spending time in nature with others who have glimpsed this truth, you remove what's been occupying your mind, creating space for awareness to naturally reveal itself."

      <h3>Yosemite National Park Retreat: Realize Awareness This October</h3>
      <p>October | 2 nights | $175</p>
      <p><strong>Fully Booked For Now</strong></p>
      <p>DM Me ‚ÄúRetreat‚Äù<br>
      The full retreat price is $175 (includes everything). Stripe will show $200 by default, feel free to uncheck the optional $25 tent rental.</p>

      <p>Stop seeking what you already are. Join 9 others in discovering the awareness that's reading these words right now.</p>

      <h4>What to expect</h4>
      <p>Through walking meditation in Yosemite and direct self-inquiry, we'll look at what keeps awareness from recognizing itself. This isn't about learning techniques or spiritual practices, just present looking at what's already here.</p>
      <p>Connect with others who are done with seeking and ready to recognize what was never missing. Together we'll discover how to rest naturally as the awareness that's reading these words right now.</p>
      <p>This intimate group setting allows for authentic sharing and the kind of recognition that happens when awareness sees itself in another. Nothing brings you closer to awareness than seeing it in others.</p>

        <p class="meta">August 2025 ‚Ä¢ 17s</p>
        <p>When you have a thought say it out loud. Keep doing this until it feels like you're talking to yourself. Eventually it will feel wierd to think. You'll have this silence until the thoughts come back again of course. But keep doing this, just notice what happens.</p>

        <p class="meta">August 2025 ‚Ä¢ 8s</p>
        <p>Thinking isn't your problem, it's the belief that you need to do something with every thought. Let the thoughts arise and let them fade away. Don't cling on and try and solve each and every one of them.</p>
